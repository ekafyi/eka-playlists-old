New Lemon Twigs and boy is it good!!! Retro baroque pop-ish--if this description makes sense at all, and basically just makes you want to dance around the house. I just got back from a long meeting which concluded with the possibility of my starting my first business (with a friend), with a large bottle of rum (gift from said friend), so this is rather apt.

And as today happens to be [Harkive](https://mobile.twitter.com/Harkive/status/1018887033312481288) day, I get to flood my Twitter timeline with all the songs I listen to instead of just here!
