New Twilight Sad single!

Frontman James Graham [described it](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/the-twilight-sad-new-track-im-not-here-missing-face-announce-tour) as being “about my ongoing battle with not liking myself, trying to be a good person but constantly feeling like I’m failing myself and everyone I care about.”
