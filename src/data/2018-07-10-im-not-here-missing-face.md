New Twilight Sad single!

Frontman James Graham [described it](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/the-twilight-sad-new-track-im-not-here-missing-face-announce-tour) as being “about my ongoing battle with not liking myself, trying to be a good person but constantly feeling like I’m failing myself and everyone I care about.”

HANDS UP IF YOU FEEL PERSONALLY CALLED OUT! 🙋

To be frank, I can’t remember not ever slightly resenting myself. With some practice I can keep it from growing into flaring hatred most of the time. I’m occasionally happy, usually content, always grateful, but no way could I not resent myself. I assume everyone was like that by default... or not? 🤔 

Anyway, good song. Enjoy.
