I regretfully have never heard of The Wolfhounds before, but am happy to report I have now, and have so far enjoyed their work (post-punkish noise pop, RIYL: The Weddoes). Frontman David Callahan also has an upcoming single in Slumberland's [Singles Subscription Series](http://www.slumberlandrecords.com/slr30singles).
